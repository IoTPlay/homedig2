# homedig2 v.0.21 - the Homie aligned version

A framework which creates a 'digital twin' representation of a home, and reduces the complexities of running the full solution. This version have been upgraded to work with the [MQTT open source Homie](https://homieiot.github.io) standard.

## A. The purpose of homedig2 & the Homie standard

The Purpose of `homedig2` is to make a non-homie standard comply to homie compliant settings of the messages, in order to have a *digital twin* stored for your house's device & attribute states, for standardised reporting, and interaction with other platforms, like message-based apps.    

The `homedig2` platform, or `dig2` for short, stanrdizes the messages from your home non-homie comliant devices, stores all the messages as a `digital twin`, and interacts with other platforms.    

One platform built into dig2 is [HomeBridge](https://homebridge.io), an opensource platform for projecting your house onto [Apple's Home](https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/home/) application. 

## B. Why we built it, and How it Works

For the reasons, where it fits, the framework needs, its building blocks, architecture, the putpose of using the Homie standard - problerm and solution, how this will change edge processing, see the readme file [docs/1_homedig2_why.md](docs/1_homedig2_why.md). 

See building blocks interaction diagram below, and a discussion document on it [docs/1_homedig2_how.md](docs/1_homedig2_how.md).

## C. Setting up the initiating files.

For understanding Homie, and Apple's HomeKit integration with open source [HomeBridge](https://homebridge.io), see previous section. Go to the help on the iitiating **homedig2** settings files, go to [Setting up Homie](docs/2a_Setup_Homie.md) and [Setting up HomeBridge](docs/2b_Setup_HomeBridge.md). 

## D. Deployment of the Solution.   

The solution is deployed as several docker containers. For details see [docs/3_Deployment.md](docs/3_Deployment.md).   

## E. Standard Screens

The great thing of using a standard like Homie for the incoming info from devices, is that standard reports vcan now be created for all information. See some examples [docs/6_dig2_AppScreens](docs/4_dig2_AppScreens.md). 

## F. The Code
The code is not published yet, it is a Node-RED flow, implemented as a broker between devices and other platforms. We will still publish the Node-RED flows.
