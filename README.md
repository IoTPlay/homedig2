## Why?

**YAIOTF ?** Yet another IoT Framework? What else were my options?
What problems did I have that I wanted to solve?

## Inspiration

    a. Running a Home Automation system for 3 yrs, and discovering the issues of implementing, and maintaining the system.  
    b. Amazon Web Services IoT Framework.  
    c. SAP's Leonardo IoT framework
    d. Efforts by different parties to standardize, like (homie)[https://homieiot.github.io]
    e. The inner workings of MQTT.
