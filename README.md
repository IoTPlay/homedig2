# iotp_dig2 v.0.2 - the Homie aligned version

A framework which creates a 'digital twin' representation of a home, and reduces the complexities of running the full solution. This version have been upgraded to work with the [MQTT open source Homie](https://homieiot.github.io) standard.

## A. The purpose of iotpdig2 & the Homie standard

The Purpose of `iotpdig2` is to make a non-homie standard comply to homie compliant settings of the messages, in order to have a *digital twin* stored for your house's device & attribute states, for standardised reporting, and interaction with other platforms, like message-based apps.    

The `iotpdig2` platform, or `dig2` for short, stanrdizes the messages from your home non-homie comliant devices, stores all the messages as a `digital twin`, and interacts with other platforms.    

One platform built into dig2 is [HomeBridge](https://homebridge.io), an opensource platform for projecting your house onto [Apple's Home](https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/home/) application. 

## B. Why we built it

For the reasons, where it fits, the framework needs, its building blocks, architecture, the putpose of using the Homie standard - problerm and solution, how this will change edge processing, see the readme file [docs/1_iotpdig2_why.md](docs/1_iotpdig2_why.md). 

## C. Setting up the initiating files.

Go to the help on the iitiating settings files, go to [Setting up Homie](docs/2_Setup_Homie.md) and [Setting up Homebride - Apple Homekit](docs/3_Setup_HomeBridge).

### E2. Big-ticket items & Outstanding for Next releases
1. Self-Discovery of Devices & Things.
  We will use the Homie mqtt self-discovery standard. [Homie - An MQTT Convention for IoT/M2M](https://homieiot.github.io).

2. **dig2Msgr** using Telegram not completed yet.

3. **Rules Engine** not completed yet.

4. **Registry yaml** - in HomeKit - the `service` must be an array of required services, not just one service.

5. Make it **Multi Client** so that the same framework can be hosted centrally for different clients?
