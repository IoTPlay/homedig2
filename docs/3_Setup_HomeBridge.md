# For HomeBridge : Understanding the Settings of dig2  


**About the folder structure - MyHome, and others** .   

1. This document can be viewed under the dig2 client, but also at the location: `/opt/iotplay/<3cld>_dig2/projects/Prod/Docs` where <3cld> defaults to `myh` for `my home`, but can be replaced by 3 letters which identifies the client, for cases where more than one client is hosted on the same host.    

1. In this document where the pre-letters `myh` to a folder is used, this rule applies.

1. [HomeBridge](https://homebridge.io) comes preinstalled with dig2 in this version. (We maybe latero n make it a seperately installable product, for those not on Apple). **homeBridge** requirs a seperately installed broker running on Docker, accessable by the host this is running on.

## Setting up the dig2 settings files


### Folders Locations
- `/opt/iotplay/myh_dig2/projects/Prod` : The folder where dig2 Node-RED flows will install, instance Production.
- `/opt/iotplay/myh_dig2/iotp.conf`     : The settings for the house <myh>. 

### The File names  

- Settings files for `Homie`. To assist with configuring your Home in the homie standard.
    - `homieClientSetup.yml`: For setting up your IoT devices - in cases where self-discovery standards are not complied to by the device, and even if it does, you can create etra meaning per the homie standard in this file.
    - `homieTransforms.yml`: Transforms mqtt messages from non-homie appliances to the *homie* standard.

- Settings files for `homeBridge`.

### The Settings Files 

#### 1. Setting up your dig2 twin with <homieClientSetup.yml>

A yaml file, with which to create all the attributes in the `dig2 digital twin` about your devices. Each line is transferred into an MQTT message, and sent into the `dig2Homie` engine, to build the digital twin. This is a once-off event, or as you want to make changes.

Actioning the changes you made to this file, is done from the **Setup* screen, * 

``` yaml
---

# -------- Additional home Details ----------------------------------   
homieClientSetup:

  # Device Names <$name>---------------------------------------------    
    homie/ESP62/$name:                  Sprinkler System & Outside Air

  # Devices Mac Addresses <$mac>-------------------------------------
    homie/ESP62/$mac:                   "18:fe:34:cf:54:26"

  # Devices IP Addressses <$localip>---------------------------------
    homie/ESP62/$localip:                 192.168.1.42

    homie/ESP71/Light/Switch/$mqttToDevice:    espeasy/ESP71/gpio/12

```


#### 2. homieTransforms.yml 

A yaml file, which transforms incoming MQTT messages from devices, and transforms them to make them [homie standard](https://homieiot.github.io) compliant.

``` yaml

# instructions: If payload_from must go as-is to payload_to, do not map, else map in equal length array.

#      payload_from: [true,false]
#      payload_to  : [ready,lost]

    -  home/OpenMQTTGateway/version: (must go to /$fw/version)

# ==================================================
transformDeviceToHomeBridge:
# not working, one msg should be able to go to 2 msg's, thus rather take msg's to ESP rules.

## Initiating, Changing your dig2Twin

After you made changes to your setup files, the steps to get the dig2Twin to accept them. Changes are made from the Setup screen.
